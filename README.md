ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m @conradrmiller. I'm a software developer with experience in Full Stack Development and DevOps engineering.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating awesome experiences that users actually enjoy using. I have used React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Github, GitLab CI/CD, and Python.

ðŸŒ± I love learning with a passion. I truly enjoy being thrown into something I've never done before, learning it, and creating something of value from it.
